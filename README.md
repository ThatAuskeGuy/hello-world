# hello-world
This is my first repository, and I am going through the tutorial to learn how to make it.

I am ThatAuskeGuy!

I am new to GitHub and programming in general. I did not go to school for computer science, but I wish I had. Now, I am making a major career change, and it's kinda crazy! I am hoping I can make it!
